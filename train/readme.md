# info
This is a pc recreation of the taken down mobile game "tracky train".
Its gonna be 2d top down pixel art instead of orthographic voxels.
The scoring is gonna be somewhat different aswell.
The core gameplay doesn't change much tho.
The maps are all custom.

Followed the bevy_ecs_ldtk book very closely (copied & unchanged code).
